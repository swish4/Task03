# Notes

### Key Terms

* Algorithmic thinking-create/use well-defined series of steps to achieve a desired outcome.
* Decomposition-break down complex problem into components, work with 1 component at a time.
* Abstraction-strip away unnecessary details to develop generic solution or represent complex system with simple model or visualization.
* Pattern Recognition-analyze trend, use that information to work out solution 

### Beginner Code Follies

* Plan out code-encapsulation
* Readability-implementation and style-go for clear and consistent
* Ponder multiple solutions-don't just run with the first idea

### Data Science goals

* The goal is learning not just questioning
* Create a space for discussion
  * clarify key words and phrases
  
  
## Question 1:

* How many acres a head does it take to feed cattle?


### Interest:

  Interest was rather varied seeing as this question does not effect all of the population. I asked 5 ranchers and 3 non-ranchers. Several ranchers were using rather old data to answer this question. Most of their data was based on their own land rather than the surrounding area. Each had different answers because of the region they were from.

### Data Scientist Repsonse:

  I talked to a guy by the name of Dr. Sutherland. He had some good insights for me to reflect on. He pointed out his favorite questions to solve for through data were what he called "puzzle questions". He pointed out this question could use a little more meat.
  
## Question 2:

* How much does acreage per head vary from region to region in the US?

### Interest:

  I talked to ranchers from Wyoming, Nebraska and Montana. Wyoming and Nebraska were pretty similar. Montana has a wide range of terrain, so the answers differed. Grass fed beef are making a come back as consumers become more conscientious.

### Data Scientist Repsonse:

Dr. Sutherland liked that this question dug a little deeper. He did ask How I was going to answer these questions within 2 months. To some extent this question is reviewed annually by the government, keeping tabs on calf crops and what feed they are on, so sourcing the data shouldn't be too hard.

  
## Question 3:

* What type of feed decreases the number of acres per head?

### Interest:

 Several ranchers said they use the feed they use becuase of finances. It is expensive to buy more land but grassfed beef is often more profitable. There was some interest in which grasses decrease the acreage per head.

### Data Scientist Repsonse:

Dr. Sutherland had a few interesting follow up questiosn that addressed the type of cow required the least amount of acreage and regulations on such matters.
